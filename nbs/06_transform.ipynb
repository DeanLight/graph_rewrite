    "### Overview\n",
    "This final module handles the actual **graph transformation**, which our library aims to achieve. It contains general auxiliary functions for performing different operations on some graph - adding nodes, cloning them, removing edge attributes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also contains **```rewrite```**, the library's main function and the only one the user is supposed to use. ```rewrite``` allows pattern matching in an input graph, graph transformations based on transform rules (as defined in the \"rules\" module), imperative side-effects based on the matches and much more. It does so by using all the abilities presented in the previous modules and wrapping it all with a simple-to-use interface of a single function."
