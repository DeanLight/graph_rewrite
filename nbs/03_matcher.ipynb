    "### Overview\n",
    "In the previous module, the LHS Parser received an LHS string, describing some graph pattern, and parsed it to an equivalent NetworkX DiGraph. In the following module, we search for **matches** to this pattern in our input graph - That is, find all subgraphs of our input graph, which have the same structure as the pattern in terms of nodes, the edges connecting them and the attributes they all have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each match is basically a mapping from a subset of the input graph nodes to a the pattern nodes (as we can deduce what are the matched edges and attributes accordingly).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Matcher** in this module does the following:\n",
    "* **Searches for matches** in the input graph, according to some LHS pattern graph.\n",
    "* **Filters matches** based on either an explicit boolean function, or constraints given to the matcher by the parser to be handled later.\n",
    "* **Constructs a list of Match objects**, each corresponds to one of the filtered matches we've found. The list will be used in later modules, and will also allow users to see the matches and to use them imperatively.\n",
    "\n",
