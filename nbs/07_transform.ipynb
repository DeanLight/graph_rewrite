    "A rule, in the context of this module, is defined by three DiGraphs for the LHS, RHS and P components of the transformation.\n",
    "We follow the conventions of previous libraries in defining the following two maps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A map from P to LHS**, which defines the nodes, edges and attributes existing in LHS which will (or will not) be preserved in the transformation. That is, a node/edge/attribute in LHS will be preserved if there's an equivalent object mapped to it in P. This notion does not only allow *preserving and deleting objects*, but also allows *cloning* (e.g., two nodes in P mapped to the same node in LHS define a cloning of that LHS node).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A map from P to RHS**, which defines the nodes, edges and attributes that will be *added* to P in the transformation. That is, a node in RHS that is not mapped by any node in P is added to P. This notion also allows *merging* (e.g., two nodes in P mapped to the same node in RHS define a merge of the two P nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rule class contains utility functions for extracting the different groups of nodes, edges and attribute that are about to be preserved / changed during the transformation. This class will be later used during the rewriting."
